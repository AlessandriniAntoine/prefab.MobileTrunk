The MobileTrunk's robot prefab for SoftRobots. 


## Requirement
This prefab was developed as part of the SOMOROB project. The goal is to integrate a
deformable robotic trunk (softrobot) on a 4-wheeled mobile robot base equipped with 
a LIDAR and to develop its digital twin equivalent. The deformable trunk is a project
[Echelon 3](https://www.inria.fr/en/interface-inria-centre-university-lille-demonstration-space)
developed by the Defrost team at INRIA. The mobile base is developed by the company
[Robotnik automation](https://robotnik.eu/)
